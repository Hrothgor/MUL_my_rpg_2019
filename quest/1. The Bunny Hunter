Kill Bunny in the East. Get equipement and level up. Continue until you get level 8 or above.
Nothing like a day of bunny hunting, eh, #? Though, here in Coldridge Valley, there are so many bunnies it almost takes the fun out of it. In fact, recently, there've been so many bunnies in the area, it's become dangerous for me to do my daily hunting. Long story short, if you could help me kill some of the bunnies, I would appreciate it.
