Master Gadrin
Kill Wolves in the South West. Get equipement and level up. Continue until you get level 20 or above.
I hate those nasty timber wolves! But I sure like eating wolf steaks... No need to get them charging. They're all angry and ready without any help. Care but please kill them, they are dangerous for our village.
