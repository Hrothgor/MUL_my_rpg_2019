Master Gadrin
Kill Mages around the dungeon. Get equipement and level up. Continue until you get level 30 or above.
Some Mages have eluded us. My most trusted scout reports that these Mages have been looting and pillaging the countryside, all the way into Southern. We believe they are hiding around the dungeon and defending it, plotting their next move. Slay the wretches in the name of justice.
